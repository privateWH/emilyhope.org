Arguing.
Today I was taking a nap.
When I woke up she complains that I did not do the thing I promised to do.
And then suddenly I realize. She was having an argument over nothing.
Things when gets done it will done, complaining for something in the future that did not accomplish, on means she is eager to bring the future to the present moment.
Now, we can do.
Past, undone. but exam, interpret, learn and few other things.
But when we do all that we use "Now" to work with things in the Past and use "Now" to work towards the future.

Now, doesn't have to be complaint. 
Now, can be joyful.

But why you have to choose now to do the last two things?
If undone and complaint, still be undone. (Yes others things also can follow. but just take this as anchor)
