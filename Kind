It's hard to be kind and considerate， if you don't slow down，think and force to be kind.
It's hard to love something if you dont have natural attraction， it takes time to do so...
Love at first sight is so easy, you should try both and in between.
Conflict and arguments, its easy to reason through, because everyone got its perspective. But be able to sense
angry, frustration, tiresome and not able to come to an agreement in the moment is hard. 
To appreciate someone you have argument and not hate or dislike takes time and effort. But if you do, you will reward with gratitude.
