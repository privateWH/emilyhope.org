At some point I see the progresss that your mom made. I was hopeless, I thought how could we made it to June 25th? Only few days left.
But now I am going to give you one of the important word I learn from Fencing. Have faith. My teacher bill he told me to stab him and say have faith.
I hope you do too.

And your mom did many mistakes, I yield at her and she argues back. Each time I think our fight gets shorter and shorter. I am aware that during frustration you would lash out on people. Embrass that imperfection, but learn whats follow, even if you are right think what if I am wrong? 
And then admit you are wrong, argument usually is a conflict. let them know where you did the mistake.

Now back to the driving lessions,
After we did that, we started finding a perfect zone that encompasses 25,30,35,40,45.
something that I often do is just walk around when ever I have free time, like enjoy nature. it come handy if you want to teach others because the entire map is in your head already.
So we did some short intervals, on 25. just 15-30 minute in the beginning. and gradually we increase the duration.

and then uphill start is hard, so I intentionally have your mom go through those a lot. and she taught me use the hand break to start which pretty amazing (add gas, release cltch, see the revs go up to 2-3, release the hand break) thats how it works for us.first gear of course.
and then to overcome her fear of driving 40, we gradually have her run a very small interval of 40 and building her confident to get familiar with the road.

then she is having trouble with shifting gear back down.

you were actually victrum of that, when i told her to turn to lower gear right at the intersection of Errol Hassell Elementary School, (179th and Bany to be specific)  , I hope by the time you able to drive take that path and see it for your self.
