There is always a winner in one round.
Some look for money, others look for comfort, call it taste.
When doing things together, the last round doesnt really matter.
Rather, what to achieve next.
my example was, I have 'acquiShe red' taste of food, and when your mom eatting sweet potato. And I was like na not going to eat it.
But as I take the first bites. It feels unfair to her.
She can it that how come I cant?
Even though I made all the money.
