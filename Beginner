observing and being right is easier than doing while being right.
for example: for a skilled person drive in a road he can pick the spot to stop while judging the sotuation.
however, while experiences will take a lot time to respond and finding the correct location.
not saying all inexperiences will do such but your mom does it.
and make you cry a lot longer...
but I realize we should have lot more safety monitor while driving while you are in the back sit.
for example, do you got enough sun block, are you in the right position and if you are too hot or too cold, even better if we can figure out if you hungry or just poppoed
