I was looking at an Self Assessment Test for Dermatology.
I have so many words that I don't know.
But I search the definition of each word. At least I understand the Question.
So the second part, I have to pick an Answer. I have No Idea. So I want to quit again.
But I say fuck it. And I got to the Answer Page. Of course, Its gonna be wrong.
But I was going close that window too. But before I close the window. I saw the explaination of each Answers.
And then I only remember one word: Humility. 

When you think is hard. You never going to do it.
And it is going to be hard. 
You hope there is an easy way for every thing you do. But that's not likely.
Doing something to educate yourself, is better than being ignorances.
