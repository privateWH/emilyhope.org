作曲：邓智伟&庄冬昕
林峯：
We are bulletproof so fire away
I will take a hit for you
就像我跟你们从没有离别
We are bulletproof so fire away
若要闯一起外闯
We fight as one,there's nothing they can do

[Annotation:  Emily, everything will come to an end. The greatest fool is invincible. In the beginning you are dependent, gradually you become independent. As you grow older, you will have to become part of the society. By then, you will have ambition, have dreams and hopes. In the journey of life, you will autonomy for the job and problem you will solve. For the current masculinity status, we fight as one to do things that female usually don’t want to do. Consider examples as: fire fighter, construction worker and etc. There is no gender bias, but simple observation. But you should take away there is masculinity and feminism.]

RAP(欧阳靖)：
(粤语不懂，欢迎指正)
有啲嘢唔使讲大家心照
一班兄弟简直同一个心跳
[Annotation: The less you speak, the more you can hear and think about. There is obedient and rebellion. either cases, you should guide by what you feel is right. No one can take away, your feeling for righthorness. If you work in a team, obey your superiority but always challenge their technicality. once in a while, question their view and their ideology, just like one day you should question and disobey everything I have annotated here. In this lyric it mention Brotherhood, but in generality: is make up of more than 1 person. so it applies 1+. In the world everything have its own life, so call heart beat. you have to tape into it with your own heart and really be able to feel it. Look small, Look big, Look randomly….]

互相关照无论任何情况
有福同享有难同当
[Annotation: Competition is built in to human, aware of yourself everytime when you win. and you did win. and what happen if you intentionally lose. Also, accept failure as winning if you really have to, because you know: you win a path into the unknown. In the world (which where competition happen) take a higher look (aid and share). Giving up something you love or want is hard. Aid is slightly easier because I believe that is also built into humanity.]

无数嘅回忆一直留住喺脑海
究竟系缘份定祇系好彩
点都好每人有自己嘅过去
之前所有嘅误会当粉笔字抹走佢
[Annotation: In case if you fall in love with a “bad dude”. history, history and history… they are no sinner, only once sinful by standard.]

喺战场上唔止系一班棋
[Annotation: Life is like a game. player are the game. so it’s okay to be in the game. Until some day, you can see through the game of life. just trust in good. religion might be a good start, and I wish you lucky!]

每次准备出发一齐出生入死
讲到尾真心不能代替
愿意牺牲一切有今生冇来世
[Annotation: Don’t wait until departure. people often being sincere and aware all the play and competition is insignificant in the end. therefore you should be smarter, just trust your team, or yourself by the guidances of your righteousness (whatever that might be: I hope it maybe love, your best course of action by logic, consideration) ). 

有人博攞彩有人博出位
[Annotation: similarity: there are ways people motivated to work towards, when they need something. It’s okay if some wants fame, some wants power or whatever metrics that you will face at the time.]

我哋之间只有两个字兄弟
飞虎嘅态度永远不变
[Annotation: Every role in society have their own perspective, if you want to understand them, you can look at what they do, feel what are, learn what they know, its a lot of work but if you want to know there is way.]

就算各自各路终有一日必会再见
[Annotation: If death is a choice by your time, which immortality do exists then you should know, there are many many many paths you can choose, but they all lead to one - humanity. some people you meet once, but in the mind, space and time you will revisit again. And when you do see the same person again. I hope you prepared??? Interesting one, I have my issue with this one so I can teach you much on this one.]

林峯：
We are bulletproof so fire away
I will take a hit for you
就像我跟你们从没有离别
We are bulletproof so fire away
若要闯一起外闯

We fight as one, there's nothing they can do
[Annotation: To figure out “they” is hard, my best advice is to think “infinity possible dimensions” if to figure out “they” is very important to you. think about it, think deeper, or you might have to spend a long long long time to understand “they”]


RAP(欧阳靖)：
They say life's a movie and ours is action packed
promise I'll watch your front
trust that you'll have my back
forever side by side and that's a fact
until the final scene and even after that
They say life's a movie and ours is action packed
promise I'll watch your front
trust that you'll have my back
together we ride or die and that's a fact
until the final scene and even after that
[Annotation: Infinity and Beyond a famous quote from “Toy Story”. sometimes when you think the final scene is the final scene, but really there could be “even after that”… Call that the surprise of life…]
