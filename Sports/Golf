Long distance, speed influence by wind. Observable by tree and water surface. 

Short distance technique, control and contour of the land scape.

Mid distance: “style” dynamics in hitting speed (unless you can determine the dropzone) 

Observation Notes -
Rigiously consistent movement
Initial impact - between ball, golf club, and the surrounding surface (sand, grass, mud)
