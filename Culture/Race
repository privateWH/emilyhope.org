Culture hint: Who you choose to be friends with reveals something.
Who you marry to reveals something.

a race culture, meaning by head counts of a color. 
Give you a pretty good estimate of what culture was brough up forth.

A duty of "polymer" is one captures a large percent of head count by race.
2. harmonize with the race you were grow up with.

So consider:
If the city is mostly caucasian being friends with caucasian allow you to be part of that community.
If you happen to be chinese, and you live in a caucasian community and there are few chinese then harmonize with existing chinese is also an element.
If you happen to be in a town that's neither. say some village remotely on this planet. the local culture should be understood. usually clothing, food, are camouflage mechanisms. 
Unless you are in a city of celebrating and strongly favor a unique characteristics other wise previous strategy is most likely appliable.
