So I heard "sir" for the second time today.
Both times I can sense something wrong, but I was question where is the balance point.
Blah. Blah Blah.
1st. I cut off someone's show of interest. dude. first time i got to work
2nd. I "demoralize" someone's value of tools. second time, I was excited for this new toy. a toy can turn into professional pretty quickly....
