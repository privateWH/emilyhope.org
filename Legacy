A teaching.
After worry about if your mother passed its quiz. And she finally receives a pay check.
Sometimes I wonder， if you equip with the wrong student for the skills，and sabatogizes the good that you want to build. was it okay？
I still remember Thomas who taught me playing Ping Pong. And I didnt give him the credit. And I am still embrassed up til today.
To forget where you learn your skill and the philsophy of teaching is to be in-line with the method of doing being taught.
But I know its okay， because mostly the person does the work（learned）gets the credit and is no longer the teachers responsibility for how they make life choices.
