A teaching.
After worry about if your mother passed its quiz. And she finally receives a pay check.
Sometimes I wonder， if you equip with the wrong student for the skills，and sabatogizes the good that you want to build. was it okay？
I still remember Thomas who taught me playing Ping Pong. And I didnt give him the credit. And I am still embrassed up til today.
To forget where you learn your skill and the philsophy of teaching is to be in-line with the method of doing being taught.
But I know its okay， because mostly the person does the work（learned）gets the credit and is no longer the teachers responsibility for how they make life choices.

The reason I want to brough up was.
If you help others and they do things you dislike.
If you devote a lot of love and care but in return just hurting you.
If you invested in time and resources to make something work and sabotage in a flash.

All those showing how life will come back at you， even when you did the best you could.
