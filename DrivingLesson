Drive a stickshift.
1. put on neutural and hand break on. Focus on listening for the engine and get a sense of the revs. 
Practice until you can hear it working hard ( around 2-3k rpm) higher usually okay for veginner.
2. on flat land, build up revs, and release clitch (assume first gear is choosen. this reduce compexity so only focus on harmony between rec and clitch)

3. repeatly saying out loud (apply clitch, push gas or break, and release clitch to active) 
4. do step 3 with force being applied  gradually, (indirectly you will be able to have the  timing of it right, which can be observe by listen the engine or feel the viberation of the car. obviously, it will move if works.
5. when parking, repeatly saying out loud 'apply litle gas, always prepare to stop)
6. practice at your disgression, its the fear of hitting something that prevent you from the tight spaces)

there is bunch of sighting which can be applicable, but I am not good with it. be nice to parking attendance, maybe they will show you the cool trick)

also, i thought about asking questions.
if you asking someone who is low in the hiercahcy of society, you boost their confident. if you ask someone busy and high... i don't know but you should remember the first rule)

oh yeah, if you take the easy way in the beginning say driving an automatic, you get the benefit of being able to drive on the road.
but if you do the thing I told you, you can do that too and hopefullyore.

credit goes to where is due.
